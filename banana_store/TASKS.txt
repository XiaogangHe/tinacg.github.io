=====

if Desistencia, then do not subtract from container totals (Chegando)

Does callback to child_modified provide previous values?

Count total number of line items per container, to verify against physical
paper copies

nesting line items as children of pedidos complicates aggregating data, beyond
my experience level right now

find a way to store container number, when changing status to Reserva (add
callback to child_modified?)

Editing a line item should change totals

autocomplete when entering codigo and clientes name. Entering a number also
fills in the string, and entering a string fills in the number

clicking on an edit button, icon, or link opens a modal with edit form (and x)
"On submit" it becomes gray and callback closes it

aggregate by cliente, produto, vendedor, container

checkbox to decide if "inactive" line items are included in aggregate lists,
simply use a ng-show on each element

how to handle multiple chegandos on same item? could tally by codigo and
concatenate the multiple containers into a string

line item's container label should be auto-computed

for testing, create child from firebaseRef based on user id.
the test branch is a sibling of banana_store
